# q-Factor Model Reproduction

This repository contains a reproduction of the q-Factor model, a well-known asset pricing model used in finance. The q-Factor model aims to explain the cross-section of stock returns based on several key factors derived from firm characteristics，such as Company Size, Return on Equity (ROE) and Annual Investments (IA).

## Overview

The q-Factor model extends the traditional Fama-French factor models by introducing new factors that are believed to better capture the variations in expected returns. This repository includes code for:
- Data preparation and processing.
- Construction of the q-Factor model.
- Replication of the empirical tests and results.
- Comparison of the q-Factor model with other asset pricing models.
